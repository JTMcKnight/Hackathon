# Hackathon
For the first hackathon

Some suggested Presentation verbiage:

Team Paradigm’s prototype focuses on an “intuitive interface” that does not need much explaining; users can figure out how it works as soon as it is fired up.  If an interface works the way users expect it to, they do not need to learn how to use it.  It must fit the user.

 Intuitive interfaces have real advantages:

   •	 Create happy users  
   •	 Require less training and support
